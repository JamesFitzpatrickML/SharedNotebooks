    "Recall that any optimisation problem is characterised by its variables, constraints on those variables and an objective function. The variables are the objects with which we represent a solution - the assigned values form a solution, the constraints define whether or not a given solution is _feasible_ and the objective function is a many-to-one mapping from the set of variables to a real-valued constant that ascribes a value to a solution.\n",

    "Linear programming problems are a special case in which all constraints and the objective function are linear combinations of the variables and the variables themselves are non-negative continuous-valued variables with finite upper bounds on their assigned values.

Machine A is specialised for intricate work, and a skilled operator can make a unit of Product X, Y and Z in 0.08, 0.11 and 0.18 hours respectively with it. Machine B is older and is more effective for less intricate work. Making units of products X, Y and Z with machine B takes 0.19, 0.07 and 0.15 hours, respectively, with Machine B. For each machine, we may only allow 150 hours of labour per month. What is the maximum profit we make can make under these conditions, and how much of each product do we produce?"

These workers are expected to be required to deal with at least 450 cases per day, but there is space enough in the office for only 40 new workers. The insurance company has determined that it can hire a mix of new permanent workers and also temporary workers, since this workload will be managed as time goes on. A permanent worker will be able to process 16 claims per day, while temporary workers will be able to process, on average, twelve per day. However, it is expected that, on a daily basis, an average permanent worker will make 0.5 mistakes in the filing process, while a temporary worker makes about 1.4 mistakes on average. The reputation of the company is important, and quality guarantees allow for no more than 25 mistakes per day across all cases served. If it costs 96 euro per day to hire a permanent worker and 70 euros per day to hire a temporary worker, how many workers do we hire of each type and what is the total cost, if we seek to minimise the cost per day of hiring the new workers?"
