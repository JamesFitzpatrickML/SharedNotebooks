    "In many cases we will find that (MI)LPs will be large enough that writing them down mathematically is tedious and that writing them as problems for our favourite solver is even more tedious. There may be many variables and constraints in a given problem, and the coefficients of the constraint matrix may be subject to change. If this is the case, it is best that we do not need to write out a new model every time we wish to solve a set of related problems. We will see in this tutorial an example of such a situation in the context of the classic Combinatorial Optimisation Problem: the Knapsack Problem."
