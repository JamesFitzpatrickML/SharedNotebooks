    "In class we saw an example of an optimisation problem. Analysis of the business problem revealed a suitbale formulation for the problem as a Linear Programming problem. Once the problem could be formulated it could then be written down as a mathematical model. Once the mathematical model is determined, it remains to take this problem and write it down using a modelling language so that we may use computational tools to solve it. This is usually the easiest part of the solution process, and may not be the final step. Inspection of the solution to the problem as formulated may reveal deficiencies in the modelling, necessitating changes to the formulation or even to the problem that is being solved.\n",
